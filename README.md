```phyton
print('What is your name?')
name = input()  # read a single line and store it in the variable "name"
print('Hi ' + name + '!')
```
# This program reads two numbers and prints their sum:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
print(a + b + c)

# Can you change it so it can add three numbers?
